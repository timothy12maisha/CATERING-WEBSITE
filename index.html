                            Swahili cuisine is enjoyed by numerous Kenyans and is obviously most prevalent in Kenya.
                            Originally from the coast, Swahili cuisine has penetrated all corners of the country and is
                            not just enjoyed all over the country.

                        While everyone has their favorite dish, we hit up Lebanese-American food blogger Bethany
                        Kehdy of dirtykitchensecrets.com for her take.
                        Her favorite dishes are simple and rustic, such as m'jadarrah. That's a lentil stew (also
                        known as poor man's stew) consisting of slow-cooked lentils with a sprinkling of burghul and
                        caramelized onions and served with a side of zesty cabbage salad.
                        Or kishik -- a porridge made from burghul fermented with yogurt and dried in the sun on
                        rooftops over seven days during the fall before being ground into fine powder.

                        Whenever someone mentions British food, fish and chips will inevitably come to mind. This
                        quintessential dish is one of the UK’s most famous exports, and rightfully so. There’s
                        nothing more comforting than soft slices of fish encased within crispy batter served
                        together with fluffy chips.

                        However, British food is much more than just this world-renowned favourite. Whether its a
                        full English breakfast with a plethora of items, the peculiar “bangers and mash”, or the
                        quaint scotch egg, British foods typically have a long and storied history. Some are even
                        regional specialties which means that you have to travel to a certain location to try them.

                        Italian food is one of the few global cuisines that Indians are truly obsessed with. Italian
                        food regularly features on the dining tables of most urban Indian households, and more often
                        than not, we fall back on pastas, pizzas and risottos to satisfy our cravings for a good
                        meal.

                            Irish cuisine is the style of cooking that originated from Ireland, an island in the
                            North Atlantic; or was developed by the Irish people. It has evolved from centuries of
                            social and political change, and the mixing of the different cultures in Ireland,
                            predominantly the English and Irish (and, in Ulster, the Scottish). The cuisine is
                            founded upon the crops and animals farmed in its temperate climate and the abundance of
                            fresh fish and seafood from the surrounding clean waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
